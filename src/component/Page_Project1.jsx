            <p>We are looking at Ann Arbor as the prototype college town in the US, where more than 34% of students come from other states and countries [1][2], they have to face a high price for food and a low variety of options. This could create nutrition problems and mental health that follows.</p>

            <h5 style={{marginTop:'3%', fontWeight:'bold'}}>Sketching technique</h5>
            <p>The sketches start from the possibilities of the solution to the storyboard to check how users’ flows are when they have to deal with the problem statement when our solution is yet to exist. I choose to develop the project from the idea of how user flow should be on the Miro.com board and started creating the layout and wireframe of each page by Illustrator after pickup from the sketches, then transfer them into low and develop the high-fidelity on Figma desktop where most design and artwork did in Adobe Illustrator.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="ti-col">
             <h5 style={{marginTop:'3%', fontWeight:'bold'}}>Pros of the current approach </h5>
             <p>Pros: It is fast to come up with the solution without checking with enough testers in the process which allows us to create a lot of ideas and sprint to the final product faster. Additionally, this approach from making sure we are on the right track to tackle the problem we propose in the beginning. </p>
          </div>
          <div className="ti-col">
             <h5 style={{marginTop:'3%', fontWeight:'bold'}}>Cons of the current approach</h5>
             <p>Cons: there is not enough time to make sure if the flow really works or if the solution will really respond to the public. If we can add more phases where we can deal with data from either databases or interviews, I believe the app could be closer to reality.</p>

          <div className="ti-col">
            <h5 style={{marginTop:'3%', fontWeight:'bold'}}>Design Progression</h5>
            <p>From the initial sketches and idea that the solution could focus more on how to get students to access ingredients for cooking for cheaper prices which have to deal with the distribution of products and storing a large number of items or delivering items to users like how Instacard or Gopuff that I have done in the competitor analysis, after doing sketch solution, storyboard, and persona, I have found out that the solution could be simpler by creating a connection and let students help each other out in a community level could be another option that is practical and easy to implement.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="ti-col">
             <h5 style={{marginTop:'3%', fontWeight:'bold'}}>Design Philosophy </h5>
             <p>The main design philosophy in this app includes simplicity and security. We would like to make sure that users feel safe and have enough information to make a decision hence there are more questions at every step. On the other hand, I believe that having a limited filtered map for each feature will also help them narrow down choices and get them to focus and understand each function easier according to Hick’s Law explained by  Lidwell et al. (2010) but there is still need to be more consideration that if the map is more open which include all feature within just the first page which users can choose to filter out what they want at that moment of using would be better in term of seamless experiences they will gain from the app.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="ti-col">
             <h5 style={{marginTop:'3%', fontWeight:'bold'}}>Impact</h5>
             <p>This app is meant to help society from the student's community level which is large and will enable them to battle the hunger and nutrition problems that could hinder them from their best ability at school. The project is scalable and not only unique only to the University of Michigan and can also be applicable at other universities across the US as well. Additionally, not only this app is will combat will the food and well-being of students but also create communities where they can connect students together through activities they do together, I believe it could help lessen the boundary for students from different schools and even their educational degrees they are studying as well. The form of connection will make the tide stronger at both domestic and international levels from a connection that has been made which will be beneficial to society as a whole in the end. </p>
